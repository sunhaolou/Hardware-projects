### TO DO
write a 32-Bit CSA.

#### Description
I wrote a full adder. Then I wrote a 16-Bit RCA which used a series
of 16 full adders. Then I worte a 32-Bit CSA which uses three 16-Bit RCA. One
for the first half (16-Bit) of the CSA. One for the other half (16-Bit) of the
CSA with carry-in 0, and one with carry-in 1. Then by using mux, I get the 32-Bit
CSA.
